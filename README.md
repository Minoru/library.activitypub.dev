# activitypub.dev

Small static server for hosting content around the ActivityPub protocol.

The current idea being considered is to build a library of content written by
both technical and non-technical folks, with their permission. Hopefully an
archive of voices will help influence developers that are building off of the
ActivityPub protocol and designing applications.

Part of the idea is, naively following in a librarian's footsteps, to also
catalogue and categorize the works. The categories being proposed are:

* Problems - Identifies what could be improved, changed, or fixed. May be
  technical, but does not have to be.
* Analysis - Linking problems together and examining one or more possible
  solutions, which may be technical, but do not have to be.
* Experiments - For folks wanting to either build an ActivityPub application, or
  improve the protocol itself, or run an instance in an unusual way, this is an
  outlet for that work.

Hopefully this will lower the barrier of fostering a collaborative environment
between users and more developers.

## Code of Conduct

One would definitely be needed. One thing that needs to be tackled before launch
is how to properly run such a site.
