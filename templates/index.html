{{define "body"}}<h1>ActivityPub Development</h1>
<p>Welcome to a grassroots organized and operated community library for the
ActivityPub protocol and Fediverse culture. It aims to be a useful nexus of
information both technical and non-technical in nature, containing collection
volunteered by people just like you.</p>
<p>Come <a href="/shelves.html">browse the shelves</a>!</p>
<p>This library's collection has four major categories for capturing the
problems, analyses, objections, and technical experiments identified by the
community. Additionally, works are tagged to aid in finding interesting
literature. All works have primary source links when possible, and if there is
no source link provided then it is an original authored work submitted directly
to this library!</p>
<p>Your feedback, ideas for improvements, and submissions are always welcome
anytime. See how to <a href="/contributing.html">Contribute</a> or learn more
<a href="/about.html">About</a> us. If you are a developer wanting to create an
ActivityPub application, or join a community of developers, the
<a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/">
	SocialHub</a> site is a great resource.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
