<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>Adding a new work to the library is intended to be easy. All that is required
is a Fediverse account, and a willingness to grant this site with a

<p>This digital library is, much like a real one, intended to be informative and
useful. There is a baseline expectation of sincerity and quality, but it should
not be a concern to anyone earnest in their efforts. Spammers, trolls, and those
trying to purposefully toe the line to prove a point may find their submissions
rejected. Submissions by a person of another person's work will be rejected,
even if done in good faith to boost a friends' voice. All works must be in a
long-form or essay style. Short toots or quips will be rejected.</p>
<p> We only accept written content for a <a href="#problem-expectations">problem</a>,
an <a href="#analysis-expectations">analysis</a>, an
<a href="#experiment-expectations">experiment</a>, or
an <a href="#objection-expectations">objection</a>. Supporting images are typically
omitted, but if they must be included, it will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p>Are you interested in contributing an existing or new piece of work? In
either case, the textual content will be reproduced on this site in its
entirety. For existing works on other websites, personal sites for example, a
source link will be prominently included so readers can find the primary
source.</p>
<h2 id="short-names">Short-Names</h2>
<p>All accepted submissions are given a short acronym. This acts as an easy way
for others to easily refer to your submission in the future, and allows you to
refer to previous submissions with ease. We use short-names to make sure the
community has a quick way to refer to our content when discussing in the wild,
and use it in the submission process.</p>
<h2 id="problem-expectations">What are the expectations for submitting a
	"problem"?</h2>
<p>A <a href="/problems.html">Problem</a> simply outlines something challenging
with Fediverse software or the ActivityPub protocol. It can be something as
specific as a traditional "problem" or as broad a general area to draw attention
to. These submissions should strive to capture and define an area of improvement
as much as possible. It helps to try to have one submission stick to one
problem. In contrast, an analysis is better suited for tying problems
together.</p>
<p>Characterics of a good <a href="/problems.html">Problem</a> submission
involve supporting evidence (such as links or case-studies), focusing on one
topic (even if it is broad), and providing a good launching point where others
can use the problem outline to develop analyses. It answers the question: "what
is challenging?"</p>
<h2 id="analysis-expectations">What are the expectations for submitting an
	"analysis"?</h2>
<p>An <a href="/analyses.html">Analysis</a> is the heavy lifting that ties
together one or more problems in order to identify areas that may have technical
or non-technical solutions. These submissions capture a particular approach to
addressing a community-identified problem. Different analyses may address the
same problems in different ways, with differing viewpoints. It is expected that
analyses need to build off of each other, and take into consideration
objections, to really reach a high-quality and well-documented community
understanding.</p>
<p>The characteristics of a good <a href="/analyses.html">Analysis</a> include
addressing one or more problems coherently, providing an argument for the way
it tackles certain problems, and supplying reasons for or against approaches.
The approaches could be technical.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-expectations">What are the expectations for submitting an
	"experiment"?</h2>
<p>An <a href="/experiments.html">Experiment</a> is a technical software piece
of work that explores an approach outlined in an
<a href="/analyses.html">Analysis</a>. It may be accompianied with its own
analysis-like text explaining the motivation of the experiment and the way the
experiment specifically functions. It would be especially helpful, but is
optional, if it explained how it could or would be adoptable by ActivityPub or
Fediverse software, whether it is backwards-compatible, and other such
considerations.</p>
<p>Of course, experiments can be done without being tied to other pieces of work
here. But the most impactful will be able to draw a line from the
community-identified problems, through analyses, to here.</p>
<p>Characteristics of a good experiment include open source code and tying the
technical work to the community need.</p>
<h2 id="objection-expectations">What are the expectations for submitting an
	"objection"?</h2>
<p>An <a href="/objections.html">Objection</a> submission is best used when you
have concerns with any other kind of work -- even another "objection"!</p>
<p>These are the highest risk at capturing intense, heated conversations. The
intention is to have the community treat objections as though they are severe
concerns and treat the people putting them forward as helping forge and refine
good ideas, and helping push back against the bad ones. Just because someone 
submits objections does not make them a bad person.</p>
<p>As a result of an objection, the community may identify ways to address it in
whole or in part, or mitigate its concerns in a way some find acceptable. For
example, let's say an analysis had some objections, but now the author of the
analysis has talked to the objecting parties and found some new common ground.
As a result, the submitter is welcome to submit a new analysis or individually
submit objections-to-the-objections. The submitter is the best at determining
which to persue.</p>
<p>Since objections are at-risk in provoking destructive conversations, this
site encourages you to treat this site as a library -- a place for recording
what is said in a manner that is the most productive and effective as can
be.</p>
<p>A characteristic of a good <a href="/objections.html">Objection</a> is
concretely identifying specific concerns in the material being objected to. It
answers the question "what is concerning?"</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-submission">How do I make a submission?</h2>
<p>This submission process is manual given the expectation of how few and
infrequent submissions are expected to be. It is temporary given that there may
be others that wish to help out in running the digital library.</p>

<p>The expectations for submissions are above, but they are more of guidelines
and are not rules. Don't get discouraged by them!</p>
<p>The mandatory steps are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Send one or more direct message(s) to
		<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">
			@cj@mastodon.technology</a>
	with the submission simply typed into the DM directly (if new content),
	or a link to your blog (if existing content).</li>
	<li>Include a title!</li>
	<li>You may indicate whether this is a
		<a href="#problem-expectations">problem</a>,
	an <a href="#analysis-expectations">analysis</a>, an
	<a href="#experiment-expectations">experiment</a>, or an
		<a href="#objection-expectations">objection</a>.
	It can only be categorized as one thing.</li>
	<li>In the special case of submitting an
		<a href="#objection-expectations">objection</a>,
	please provide one or more short-names that the objection is objecting
	to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Optional things to include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the submission is an
		<a href="#analysis-expectations">analysis</a>, you may indicate
	which
		<a href="#problem-expectations">problem(s)</a>
	the submission is analyzing. In addition to any suggestions you make, we
	may indicate additional relevant
		<a href="#problem-expectations">problems</a>.</li>
	<li>If the submission is an
		<a href="#experiment-expectations">experiment</a>,
	you may indicate which
		<a href="#analysis-expectations">analysis/analyses</a>
	the submission is providing an experiment for. In addition to any
	suggestions you make, we may add additional
		<a href="#analysis-expectations">analyses</a>
	that appear to fit.</li>
	<li>In the special case of submitting an
		<a href="#experiment-expectations">experiment</a>,
	please be sure to provide a link to a code repository, if one exists.</li>
	<li>Finally, you may include any short-names you feel are
	related to your piece's topic. In addition to your suggestions, we may
	add additional short-names that relate to the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, the submission will be processed as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A response letting you know the submission was successfully
	received.</li>
	<li>The submission will be reviewed; if more information is needed then
	a DM back and forth will happen.</li>
	<li>If there's been heated discussion that has generated submissions
	that reflects a charged atmosphere, numerous submissions, and/or
	numerous objections, we may reach out to confirm whether to proceed with
	the submission process for all submissions sent in this period of
	time.</li>
	<li>If everything is in order to begin with, or once everything is in
	order, you'll be informed whether the submission was
	accepted/rejected.</li>
	<li>If accepted, the submission will be given a
		<a href="#short-names">short-name</a>
	and added to the website.</li>
</ol>
